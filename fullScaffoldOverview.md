# Connecting all together
FIRST: In the views.py file we import any models that we will need to us
<br>
SECOND: Use the view to query the model for data that we need
<br>
THRID: Pass results form the model to the template
<br>
FOURTH: Edit the template so that it is ready to accept and display the data from the model 
<br>
FIFTH: Map a URL to the view
